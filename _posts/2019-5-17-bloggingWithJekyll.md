How to make a totally free, totally controlled by you blog using github
** it is harder than it should be but I'm here to help

1. create a new repository in github, and initialize with readme

2. in settings, scroll down to the github pages section and select in the source tab "master branch"
.2 .a. choose a theme with the theme chooser

at this point you have a working site at https://[yourusername].github.io/[repoName]

3. your repo should have 2 files now, a README, and a config.yml. keep these. you will add 4 more files including your first blog post!

4. create a file named "index.html" under root

5. create a directory each : _layouts _data _posts
